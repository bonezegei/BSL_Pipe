### Bonezegei Scripting Language Library: Pipe

The BSL_pipe library provides an essential and intuitive mechanism for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) within the Bonezegei Scripting Language environment. It introduces the concept of a unidirectional data channel (a pipe), allowing the output stream of one process or function to be seamlessly channeled as the input stream to another, executing processes in a sequential, stream-based manner.
